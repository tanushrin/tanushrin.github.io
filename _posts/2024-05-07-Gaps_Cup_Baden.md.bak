### Discover the Flavors at Gaps Cup


Step into the world of Gaps Cup and find yourself engulfed by the rich aroma of freshly <abbr title="Brewed">gebrauten</abbr> coffee. 🌟☕ Each visit unveils new culinary <abbr title="Delights">Genüsse</abbr>, from the artful swish of Matcha 🍵 that paints the morning with vibrant greens to the <abbr title="Decadent">dekadenten</abbr> pastries 🍰 that are almost too pretty to eat (but somehow, everyone manages just fine). Watch their baristas, masters of their <abbr title="Craft">Handwerk</abbr>, magically transform ordinary coffee beans into <abbr title="Extraordinary">außergewöhnliche</abbr> caffeinated masterpieces. Enjoy their salmon toast or(and) cottage cheese toast, which have quickly become cult favorites among the regulars (like myself, no judgment if you come just for the toast). There are wraps, salads and quiches too, to tinker your taste buds. And let's not forget about the refreshing line-up of cold drinks 🥤🧊 on a shelf that looks more like a treasure trove. ![Image of pastries and Matcha at Gaps Cup](image_url_pastries_matcha)

Relax in their quirky seating arrangements, from cozy <abbr title="Hanging chairs">Hängestühle</abbr> to rustic swinging-wooden-benches, and not-your-typical decor that could easily belong in a modern gallery. Amidst all this, the lush greenery adds a fresh breath of air, making you feel like you're in a magical garden where caffeine blooms on trees. Whether you're a local in search of a peaceful <abbr title="Nook">Nische</abbr> to unwind or a traveler seeking the heartbeat of Baden's café culture, you’ll find your spot here. Their doors are open from 10 AM to 5 PM daily, except Mondays when they take a break to presumably do normal things like binge-watch their favorite series. ![Image of indoor and outdoor seating at Gaps Cup](image_url_seating)
