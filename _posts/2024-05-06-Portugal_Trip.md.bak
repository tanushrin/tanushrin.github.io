## 03- 10 Days in Portugal: A Journey Through Scenic Views and Cultural Delights


### Introduction: Seeking Sunshine and Serenity in Portugal

After weeks of enduring the cold, gray, sunless skies of Switzerland, my husband and I found ourselves yearning for a touch of sunshine and the vibrant colors of a warmer climate. Our love for walking and exploring urban landscapes, combined with a passion for rugged coastal hikes, naturally drew us towards Portugal—a country celebrated for its rich history, sunny weather, and stunning scenery.

### Arrival and First Impressions: Porto

Upon landing at Lisbon Airport, we immediately felt the buzz of anticipation for the adventures that awaited us. Opting for a scenic train ride to Porto, we departed from Lisbon Oriente train station, embarking on a journey that not only bridged cities but also blended the anticipation of new experiences with the comfort of traveling through picturesque landscapes.

### Settling in Porto

Our home base in Porto was the NH Collection Porto Batalha, strategically situated to offer both comfort and convenience. After checking in, we ventured out to explore the neighborhood, quickly getting acquainted with the charming streets that radiate the true essence of Porto.

Dinner was a delightful affair at Elebe Entreparedes. The restaurant, known for its cozy ambiance and exquisite cuisine, did not disappoint. We indulged in a variety of local dishes, each bursting with flavors that promised a gastronomic journey as exciting as our physical one. This excellent meal not only satiated our hunger but also heightened our eagerness to discover what the rest of our stay in Porto would unveil.


#### Exploring Porto

In Porto, the sunlight greeted us like a long-lost friend. The city’s vibrancy was immediately palpable, with its colorful buildings bathed in light and lively streets inviting exploration. Eager to immerse ourselves in all that Porto had to offer, we spent our first one and a half days on a sightseeing spree that took us across some of the city’s most iconic landmarks.

Our tour started with the majestic **Dom Luis Bridge**, a stunning example of industrial age engineering that offers breathtaking views of the Douro River. Strolling along the **Cais da Ribeira**, we soaked in the lively atmosphere of its bustling riverside promenade. The Gothic beauty of the **Church of São Francisco** left us awe-struck, while the opulence of **Palácio de Bolsa** showcased the city’s rich mercantile history.

The **Porto Cathedral** stood solemn and imposing, offering us a glimpse into the religious heritage of the city. Nearby, the **Clérigos Tower** called to us with its baroque elegance, promising panoramic views of the city from its heights. Our wanderings also led us to the ornate façades of **Carmo Church** and the romantic **Funicular dos Guindais**, which offered a quaint ride back to our starting point.

Each site was a chapter in Porto's open-air museum, telling tales of art, history, and culture that captivated our imaginations and warmed our spirits.
