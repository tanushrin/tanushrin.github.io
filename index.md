# Iâ€™m Tanushri Nayak

You might say Iâ€™ve been coding long enough to navigate both warp speeds and hyperdrivesâ€”but wait for itâ€”without a single dilithium crystal or hyperdrive malfunction! After 11 years navigating the tech galaxies of both the Alpha and Outer Rim, and an intensive voyage through the realms of academia, Iâ€™ve returned, ready to share my cache of knowledge and experiences.

Curious about my interstellar journey from tech pro to academia and back into the industry? Itâ€™s like an episode of "The Big Bang Theory," but with more actual science and fewer laugh tracks. And for those who've been wonderingâ€”yes, *I Know*! It sounds like a sitcom setup!

ðŸ‘‰ Beam up to this blog post to know about me: [Back to the Future: My Journey from Tech Pro to Academia and Back Again]({% post_url 2024-04-11-Who-Am-I %}).

**Coming Up:** Stay tuned for my upcoming blog series where I'll share my experiences and insights as I prepare for the Azure DP-100 certification. Join me as we dive into the world of designing and implementing Data Science solutions on Azure. Whether you're also studying for the exam or just interested in data science and cloud services, this journey is sure to offer useful lessons and tips.

So, grab your lightsaber or phaser, set your sensors to 'fun', and letâ€™s explore the universe of technology together! 

And donâ€™t worry, this blog wonâ€™t just stick to tech ðŸ˜‰; expect detours into travel, books, and whatever else crosses my mind (in future)!
