# How You Doin’? I’m [Tanushri Nayak] 🚀

You might say I’ve been coding long enough to navigate both warp speeds and hyperdrives—but wait for it—without a single dilithium crystal or hyperdrive malfunction! After 11 years navigating the tech galaxies of both the Alpha and Outer Rim, and an intensive voyage through the realms of academia, I’ve returned, ready to share my cache of knowledge and experiences.

Curious about my interstellar journey from tech pro to academia and back into the industry? It’s like an episode of "The Big Bang Theory," but with more actual science and fewer laugh tracks. And for those who've been wondering—yes, *I KNOW*! It sounds like a sitcom setup!

👉 Beam up to my latest blog post: [Back to the Future: My Journey from Tech Pro to Academia and Back Again]({% post_url 2024-04-12-Design_a_data_ingestion_strategy_for_machine_learning_project %}).

So, grab your lightsaber <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanushrin/tanushrin.github.io/main/_posts/media/lightsaber.png" width="50" height="40"> or phaser, set your sensors to 'fun', and let’s explore the universe of technology together! And don’t worry, this blog (probably) won’t just stick to tech; expect (future) detours into travel, books, and whatever else crosses my mind!

**May the force be with us!**  
And...
