You might say Iâ€™ve been coding long enough to navigate both warp speeds and hyperdrivesâ€”but wait for itâ€”without a single dilithium crystal or hyperdrive malfunction! After 11 years navigating the tech galaxies of both the Alpha and Outer Rim, and an intensive voyage through the realms of academia, Iâ€™ve returned, ready to share my cache of knowledge and experiences.

Curious about my interstellar journey from tech pro to academia and back into the industry? Itâ€™s like an episode of "The Big Bang Theory," but with more actual science and fewer laugh tracks. And for those who've been wonderingâ€”yes, *I Know*! It sounds like a sitcom setup!

ðŸ‘‰ Beam up to my latest blog post: [Back to the Future: My Journey from Tech Pro to Academia and Back Again]({% post_url 2024-04-11-Who-Am-I %}).

So, grab your lightsaber or phaser, set your sensors to 'fun', and letâ€™s explore the universe of technology together! And donâ€™t worry, this blog (probably) wonâ€™t just stick to tech; expect (future) detours into travel, books, and whatever else crosses my mind!
